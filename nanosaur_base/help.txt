development workflow :

nanosaur down
nanosaur install developer
nanosaur run core

this starts the docker container with the connection to the folder $Home/[user]nanosaur_core/src

ros2 launch nanosaur_bringup bringup.launch.py
-- starts the code from the connected folder

when you are happy do the following to persist the changes to the docker container

cd $HOME/[USER]/nanosaur_core/src/nanosaur

docker build -f dockerfile-dev -t nanosaur/nanosaur:latest

after this nanosaur reboots and all the code changes are in the docker
